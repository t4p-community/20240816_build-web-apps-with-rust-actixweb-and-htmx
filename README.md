# Learn How to Build Web Apps with Rust, Actix Web, and HTMX  

Welcome to the Build Web Apps with Rust, Actix Web, and HTMX training event!

## Getting Started

To code along with the instructor, create a fork of this repository, then create a GitHub Codespace on the fork. The `Fork` button is in the upper-right-hand corner of this page. Once forked, create the green `Code` button on your forked version to access the ability to create a Codespace.

GitHub provides a generous amount of free time for Codespaces each month (currently, 120 hours). You are responsible for any charges incurred if you exceed the free time. You can monitor your usage in the GitHub settings.

**IMPORTANT:** Because of the limited time for the course, if you run into setup problems, it will not be possible to provide individual support. If you have trouble setting up a local environment, we recommend using Codespaces. If you cannot set up a programming environment, please watch the class, and you can code along with the class recording later.

## Courseware

The `projects` folder contains the code examples

1. `hello_world_actixweb_htmx_completed` - The completed code for the "Hello, World!" example using Actix Web and HTMX.
1. `todo_list_app_part1` - The starting code for the Todo app.
